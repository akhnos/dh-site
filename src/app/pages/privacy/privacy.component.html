<h2>DreamHarvesters Privacy Policy</h2>

Effective Date: 3 March 2021

DreamHarvesters (collectively, “DreamHarvesters”, “us”, “our” or “we”) provides this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to describe the types of information we collect on our website - https://dreamharvesters.com/ (the “Website”) and through any games or mobile applications published by DreamHarvesters (the “Apps”), and how we collect, process, store, use, and manage these information, including personal information, and data from users of the Website and the Games (“Users”, “your” or “you”).

Hereinafter, we refer to both the Apps and the Website as the “Services”.

In providing the Services, DreamHarvesters acts as data controller, as defined in European Regulation n°2016/679, also known as the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”).

Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited to information and data collected or received by DreamHarvesters through your use of the Services. DreamHarvesters is not responsible for the actions of individuals with no relationship to DreamHarvesters or third-party companies. Links to those websites available on the Website do not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those individuals or companies.

When you download, install and access our Apps, we collect information that help us identify your device, such as:
- the technical features of your terminal equipment and software, such as the browser settings, the installed plug-ins, the time zone, the screen size of your device, unique device ID, Advertising ID*, Device Identifier**, the type and version of your operating system (“OS”), and your general (city/country) location (based on your IP address);

- Gameplay data - session time, details of your in-app purchases (excluding your payment or credit card information), in-app events such as spending virtual currencies, progresses in the App, timestamp, etc.;

- We may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications to send you game updates, high scores and other service-related notifications that may be of importance to you. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings or by going to the settings for the app itself.

* Advertising ID means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile devices that advertisers use for personalized advertising. They are consistent across all mobile applications and thus allow cross-app tracking.

** Device identifier / information means device type, device model, device maker, device operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or combination of this data available from a device for a developer for checking the device compatibility with a particular application.

On Apple, you can opt out of interest based advertising by selecting “limit ad tracking” option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt out of these ads by choosing “Opt-out of personalized ads”. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device.
